# Magi-Quest

ABOUT:
Magi Quest is a 2D action-platformer with levels designed to be thoroughly explored and tough to master. You play the role of Arguyle, the most skilled and deadly wizard to ever siege havoc on the Kingdom of Clovania. And I mean dead in the literal sense, as you passed away 500 years ago, but after monsters started ravaging Clovania, King Gage XII ordered to have you dug up and revived in order to defend the land and bring peace back from the foul denizens that are wreaking chaos. You don’t want any of that however, as you’d much rather be sleeping than fighting at your old age. So begins your quest to escape from the Clovanian Forest, trek through the Chillundra Glaciers, traverse the Magmire Desert, and finally crawl back into your specially made grave at the Endtime Cemetery. Onward adventurer, and achieve the eternal slumber you so desperately desire!

HOW TO PLAY:
Download Magi Quest Build, and then run MagiQuest.exe. The game is played with WASD for movement, Space Bar for jump/double jump, and J to fire. Have fun!
